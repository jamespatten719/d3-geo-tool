# Zombie Map - How many of the infected can you save? 

London has been infected by a zombie virus. Only you can save it. Drop the antidotes to save as many people as you can.
Remember, resources are limited. Only 8 drops can be placed with a max of 3 in central London. Drops must have a max radius of 2000m, apart from the final drop.
You must save at least 625,000 zombies to contain the virus - so choose wisely!
